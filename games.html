				The best thing in the world is a video game. One of my top 5 favorites is the uncharted series. My favorite character is Victor Sullivan AKA:Sully. Sully is a laid back guy who tries his best to fill his pockets. He is funny and always stands by the main character Nathan Drake. Sully is very reliable. He may be old but if comes to money you can count on Sully.

				Another one of my favorite video games is Mafia 3 and my favorite character is the protaginist Lincoln Clay. After he fought in the vietnam war his family was attacked an killed. Luckly he survived the attack and got revenge. Lincoln is ruthless and shows no mercy to his enemies. Lincoln can also be trustworthy and will always get the job done.
